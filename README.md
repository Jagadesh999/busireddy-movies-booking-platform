You're building a BookMyShow-like movie ticket booking platform — and you want to:

✅ Focus first on navigation with 10 empty screens

✅ Then build each screen step-by-step (clear objective, components, data, UX)

✅ Upload the project to GitHub

✅ Use a neat and professional repository name

✅ You want me to act as your Prompt Engineer for every step

Let’s do this like real-world app development. Below is your roadmap + repo plan + first steps.



✅ PHASE 1: Project Initialization & Navigation (10 Screens)
🔧 Tech Stack:
Frontend Framework: React.js (using create-react-app)

Routing: React Router DOM

Styling: Tailwind CSS (optional for clean UI)

🏗️ Step-by-Step Setup Guide
✅ Step 1: Create React Project
bash
Copy
Edit
npx create-react-app busireddy-movies-booking-platform
cd busireddy-movies-booking-platform
npm install react-router-dom
(Optional Tailwind CSS setup if you want styling help later)

✅ Step 2: Create 10 Screens (Pages)
Go to src/pages/ and create these 10 files:

Home.js

MovieDetails.js

Showtimes.js

SeatSelection.js

LoginSignup.js

BookingSummary.js

Payment.js

BookingSuccess.js

MyBookings.js

Profile.js

Each one has:

jsx
Copy
Edit
import React from 'react';

const Home = () => {
  return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
};

export default Home;
(Repeat for others, just change the name)

✅ Step 3: Set Up Routing in App.js
jsx
Copy
Edit
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";

import Home from "./pages/Home";
import MovieDetails from "./pages/MovieDetails";
import Showtimes from "./pages/Showtimes";
import SeatSelection from "./pages/SeatSelection";
import LoginSignup from "./pages/LoginSignup";
import BookingSummary from "./pages/BookingSummary";
import Payment from "./pages/Payment";
import BookingSuccess from "./pages/BookingSuccess";
import MyBookings from "./pages/MyBookings";
import Profile from "./pages/Profile";

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/movie">Movie Details</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/showtimes">Showtimes</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/seats">Seat Selection</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/login">Login/Signup</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/summary">Booking Summary</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/payment">Payment</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/success">Booking Success</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/bookings">My Bookings</Link></li>
          <li><Link to="/profile">Profile</Link></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>

      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/movie" element={<MovieDetails />} />
        <Route path="/showtimes" element={<Showtimes />} />
        <Route path="/seats" element={<SeatSelection />} />
        <Route path="/login" element={<LoginSignup />} />
        <Route path="/summary" element={<BookingSummary />} />
        <Route path="/payment" element={<Payment />} />
        <Route path="/success" element={<BookingSuccess />} />
        <Route path="/bookings" element={<MyBookings />} />
        <Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
✅ Step 4: Initialize Git & Push to GitHub
bash
Copy
Edit
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/busireddy-movies-booking-platform.git
git add .
git commit -m "🎬 Initial commit: Navigation and 10 blank pages added"
git push -u origin main
